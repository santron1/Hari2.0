🌱🤖 HARI – An Intelligent Agricultural Robot

Precision Farming | Edge AI | Autonomous Robotics | Rocker-Bogie Rover


---

📌 Overview

HARI is an AI-powered agricultural robot designed to make farming more efficient, intelligent, and sustainable. Built by a three–member multidisciplinary team, the project integrates embedded systems, robotics, mechanical engineering, and machine learning into a rugged ground robot capable of navigating uneven terrains and providing real-time agronomic insights.

This repository contains the core code modules used in the HARI robot—robot arm control, real-time sensor monitoring, and edge-based plant disease detection workflows.

> 🚀 HARI reached the final round of the Accenture Innovation Challenge 2024 (Sandbox Round)
Due to academic commitments, the team could not attend the finale in Chennai.

🌟 Features at a Glance

AI-driven plant disease detection using a custom CNN deployed via Edge Impulse

ESP32-CAM for real-time leaf analysis on the edge (no cloud required)

Rocker-bogie suspension inspired by NASA’s Mars Rovers

Modular sensor suite for soil & environmental monitoring

Web-based dashboard for live telemetry and robot-arm control

Record & playback system for automated arm movements

Future-ready architecture designed for cloud analytics & autonomous navigation



---

🧠 AI & Embedded Intelligence

HARI uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) deployed on the ESP32-CAM to classify plant diseases directly on-device.

Tools & Platforms:

Edge Impulse → Model training, optimization, and quantization

ESP32-CAM → On-edge inference & imaging

ESP32 DevKit → Main controller + local HTTP server + data aggregator


Planned Cloud Integration:

Crop health dashboards

Soil & atmospheric analysis reports

Historical farm analytics



---

🚜 Mechanical System – Rocker-Bogie Suspension

To ensure stable mobility across farms, mud, pits, and uneven terrains, HARI uses a six-wheel rocker-bogie system, the same mechanism used in NASA’s Curiosity and Perseverance rovers.

Benefits:

✓ Maximum wheel contact

✓ No active suspension required

✓ Excellent obstacle handling

✓ High stability on rough terrain



---

🔧 Sensors & Data Acquisition

HARI integrates multiple low-cost sensors for real-time agricultural analytics.

Sensor	Purpose

DHT11	Temperature + Humidity
Rain Sensor	Precipitation detection
BMP180	Atmospheric pressure + temperature
Soil Moisture Sensors (x2)	Irrigation analysis
(Planned) Soil Nitrogen Sensor	Nutrient profiling
(Planned) Micro-agri Drone	Aerial mapping
